Objective: This assignment aims to assess your basic programming skills and problem-solving abilities related to data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming principles. The goal is to create solutions for four distinct problems using your preferred programming language, demonstrating proficiency in implementing fundamental programming concepts within a limited timeframe. The expected learning outcomes include showcasing your ability to translate problem descriptions into functional code, adhering to specified input/output requirements, and effectively managing time constraints.

Step-by-Step Instructions:

Problem-1 (Calculator): Implement a class-based calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
Create a class named Calculator.
Define methods within the class for each operation: add, subtract, multiply, divide.
Each method should accept two double-precision floating-point numbers as input (a and b).
The operation type should be a string input indicating which operation to perform.
Return the result of the calculation. Handle division by zero appropriately.

Problem-2 (Series Generation - Odd Numbers): Generate a series of odd numbers up to a specified limit.
Accept a single integer a as input.
Generate a series of odd numbers starting from 1, incrementing by 2 in each step.
Continue generating numbers until the number of generated odd numbers equals a.
Output the generated series as a comma-separated string.

Problem-3 (Series Generation - Selective Odd Numbers): Generate a series of odd numbers selectively based on the input.
Accept a single integer a as input.
If a is even, generate odd numbers until a/2 numbers is equal to x, then output series (1,3,5,7,9…)
If a is odd, generate odd numbers until (a+1)/2 numbers is equal to x, then output series (1,3,5,7,9…)
Output the generated series as a comma-separated string.

Problem-4 (Dictionary Count of Multiples): Count the number of elements in a list that are multiples of numbers from 1 to 9.
Accept a list of integers as input.
Create a dictionary with keys from 1 to 9.
Iterate through the input list.
For each number in the list, check if it is a multiple of each number from 1 to 9.
If it is a multiple, increment the corresponding count in the dictionary.
Output the dictionary.
